# Supply-Chain-Management-Dashboard-Power-BI

## Project Title
**Supply Chain Management Dashboard in Power BI**  

This project provides a comprehensive overview of the supply chain process using a mock dataset. It tracks key KPIs such as revenue, profit margin, stock levels, supplier performance, and logistics costs. The dashboard is designed to help businesses improve efficiency, reduce costs, and make data-driven decisions across procurement, inventory, and distribution functions.

## Problem Statement
Supply chains involve multiple stakeholders â€” suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers. Tracking performance across these stages is challenging because of siloed data, lack of visibility, and difficulties in analyzing key metrics.  

Companies need clear visibility into:
- Revenue by product type, SKU, and customer demographics  
- Supplier quality and defect rates  
- Inventory levels and order quantities  
- Logistics performance and transportation costs  

Without an integrated dashboard, inefficiencies remain hidden and decision-making is delayed.

## Flow of the Project
1. **Data Gathering** â€“ Collected supply chain mock data (CSV) including revenue, orders, suppliers, stock levels, and transportation costs.  
2. **Data Cleaning / Transformation** â€“ Removed unnecessary attributes, renamed fields, and standardized formats in Power Query.  
3. **Data Modeling** â€“ Built relationships between fact and dimension tables (e.g., SKU, Supplier, Transportation Mode).  
4. **DAX Functions** â€“ Created measures for KPIs: Total Revenue, Total Cost, Avg Profit Margin %, Stock Level, Order Quantity, Defect Rate %.  
5. **Dashboard Design** â€“ Developed three pages: Overview, Products, Supplies.  
6. **Navigation** â€“ Added interactive filters for SKU and Supplier to drill into insights.
